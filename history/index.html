          Ada Lovelace was the first programmer EVER and she was a WOMAN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ada Lovelace had a huge impact of computer programming. There are lots of interesting
          articles about women in computing and the history behind how CS became a male dominated
          field. There is also a class at Illinois Tech that is taught by Mars Hick if you are 
          interested in that!

        <h3>Who was Lord Byron?</h3>
        <p>
          Lord Byron was one of the leading figures of the Romantic Movement in early 19th century England.
          He was well known for his sexual escapades and his beautiful and brilliany peotry writings. Here is an example of a very famous one:

        <h3>What was his impact?</h3>
        <p>
          Lord Byron's bisexuality was known "on the street" because he was very open about it at a time when it wasnt "acceptable". Unfortunetly,
          it was well known that Byron did not treat women well and some even said he was a "womanizer". A lot of his life was spent trying to
          actively support the Greek struggle for independence from Ottoman rule. There are many LGBTQ+ folks today who Lord Byron influences
          many through his poetry and sexuality.
