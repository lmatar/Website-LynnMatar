      <h3>What was his impactLord Byron?</h3>
      <p>
        Lord Byron's bisexuality was known "on the street" because he was very open about it at a time when it wasnt "acceptable". Unfortunetly,
        it was well known that Byron did not treat women well and some even said he was a "womanizer". A lot of his life was spent trying to
        actively support the Greek struggle for independence from Ottoman rule. There are many queer folks today who Lord Byron influences
        many through his poetry and sexuality.
