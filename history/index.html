        <p>
          Ada Lovelace (also known as Ada Byron) was born on December 10, 1815, in London.
          She was a Victorian-era mathematician who is well-known for her work with
          <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Babbage">Charles Babbage </a>
          on the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Analytical-Engine">Analytic Engine</a> and is widely celebrated
          as the first computer programmer.

          Ada Lovelace had a huge impact of computer programming. There are lots of interesting
          articles about women in computing and the history behind how CS became a male dominated
          field. There is also a class at Illinois Tech that is taught by Mars Hick if you are
          interested in that!

        <p>
          Ada’s mother, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Byron">Lady Byron</a>, insisted that Ada be tutored privately and study mathematics too (at the
          time that was an unusual education for a woman). Ada Lovelace's main work is the "Notes", which is
          the culmination of Lovelace's paper, following many pages of detailed explanation of the operation
          of the Engine and the cards, and the notation of the tables.

          She created the stepwise sequence of operations for solving certain mathematical problems (the machine progressed through
          a string of instructions input from punched cards).  There were seven explanatory notes to her translation,
          which run about three times the length of the original work by Babbage. This represents the most complete contemporary account
          in English of this much-misunderstood machine! The picture above is Lovelace's diagram from "note G", the first published computer.

            Ada also expanded upon Babbage’s general views of the Analytical Engine as a symbol-manipulating device
            rather than a mere processor of numbers, suggesting that it “might act upon other things besides number”
          </li>
          <li>
            She was the first to express the potential for computers outside mathematics and  envisioned a machine
            that could also process musical notes, letters and images, anticipates modern computers by a hundred years.

        <p>
          The nineteenth century society was very patriarchal. Women supposed to have the role of mere observers, wives,
          or mothers because they were not considered as “independent” or as “mature”. This is still present today unfortunetly but to a lesser extent
          in English and American cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ada was still able to manage to be successful despite the many restrictions on women at the time.
          The fact that she was born into a wealthy family and had a good education was a factor but that does not
          remove the fact that she had a brilliant mind and a vision.
          Ada also received support from her husband, William King. He copied articles for her in libraries because
          as a woman she was not allowed to go to libraries

          Ada was pretty popular in the steampunk circle. Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction that incorporates retro futuristic
          technology and aesthetics inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery.  It comes from the idea that
          technology never developed beyond steampunk (steamengines).

          Charles Babbage (1791–1871) was fascinated by math at an early age and went to Cambridge. He then took off
          on his own to found the Analytical Society in 1812. The society helped transform the field of math in Britain.
          He also became a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge. He was an inventor and helped create Britain’s
          modern postal service, a cowcatcher for trains, and other tools.

          The Analytical Engine paper was a French book that was published was by Babbage and Luigi Federico Menabrea
          (later Prime Minister of Italy) prepared it from his notes and had an account of her own. Menabrea’s account
          dealt little with mechanical details. Instead he described the functional organization and mathematical operation
          of this more flexible and powerful invention.
